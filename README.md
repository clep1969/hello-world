# hello-world
A test repository to learn how to work with GitHub.

I've been a web developer since 1998. I've been employed by big, conservative companies and institutions since 2003, so I've missed out on a lot of things that modern developers have grown up with. I'm using GitHub to help bring my skills into 2018.
